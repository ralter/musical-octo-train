*A working repositor of my personal Nvim Config*
This config is an amalgamation of other tutorials etc. as well as my old vim config.
This will be continually updated as I continue trying to improve on it.
My primary issue currently is in regards to Packer installation.
It installs and then tries to delete itself during Sync.
